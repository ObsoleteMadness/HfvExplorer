<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="General"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p><br>HFVExplorer is an HFS volume browser for Windows 9x and Windows
NT4/5.
<p>This project started some two years ago (fall 1996) as a read-only,
Explorer like viewer and launch pad for <a href="#RelatedWork">ARDI Executor</a>
HFV volume files. Since then, the program has gradually evolved to do much
more than that. Most people use it to transfer files between Macintosh
HFS volumes and Windows VFAT or NTFS volumes. It can also read Mac CD's
and 1.4MB floppies.&nbsp; 400k and 800k Mac floppies cannot me read, due
to the limitations of PC floppy controller.
<p>The program is tested under Windows 95 (release, service pack 1 and
OSR2), Windows 98 release (without service packs), Windows NT 4.0 service
pack 3, Windows NT 5.0 beta 1 and beta 2.
<p>HFVExplorer is experimental freeware software.
<p>HFVExplorer is distributed under the <a href="#License">GNU general
public license (GPL)</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="WhyNeed"></a>Why is this program needed?</h1>

<p><br>Windows 9x and Windows NT do not ship with out-of-the-box support
for reading Macintosh <b>Hierarchical File System (HFS)</b> formatted media,
and some third party solution is therefore needed.
<p>There are many (over a dozen or so) other Win32 utilities that implement
more or less the same functionality than HFVExplorer. Some of them are
listed in the <a href="#Alternative">alternative solutions</a> section.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="Installation"></a>Installation</h1>

<ol>
<li>
Extract all of the files to the directory of your choice. HFVExplorer initially
shows all HFV, DSK and HFx files from the directory of the executable,
so it is convenient to place them into a directory where you have your
HFV and DSK files.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If you are running Windows 95/98: move the file <b>Cdenable.vxd</b> to
"\Windows\System" directory. This file is needed to access Macintosh formatted
CD's under Windows.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If you are running Windows NT 4/5: move the file <b>Cdenable.sys</b> to
"\Winnt\System32\Drivers" directory. This file is needed to access Macintosh
formatted CD's under NT. After moving the driver, the program must be run
once with system administrator rights. Later normal user rights suffice.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Start HFVExplorer and go to the options dialog (View menu). Check all of
the property pages to suit your needs.</li>
</ol>

<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;
<p>As you can see, the program is very much like Windows Explorer, and
to keep the learning curve at absolute minimum, most commands follow Explorer
conventions.
<p>Click on the area in the picture above to jump to the description.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="tree_view"></a>Tree view of the volumes</h2>
HFS volumes are shown with white icons. They may be HFV or DSK volume files
(<img SRC="hfs_hd_icon_small.gif" height=16 width=16>), CD's (<img SRC="hfs_cd_icon_small.gif" height=16 width=16>)
or floppy disks (<img SRC="hfs_floppy_icon_small.gif" height=16 width=16>).
Windows volumes are shown with yellow icons; hard disks (<img SRC="dos_hd_icon_small.gif" height=16 width=16>),
floppies (<img SRC="dos_floppy_icon_small.gif" height=16 width=16>), network
drives (<img SRC="dos_net_icon_small.gif" height=16 width=16>), CD's (<img SRC="dos_cd_icon_small.gif" height=16 width=16>)
or RAM disks (<img SRC="dos_ram_icon_small.gif" height=16 width=16>).
<p>The tree view is updated automatically when you insert or remove a CD,
but only if you have auto-insert notification enabled. Switching floppies
<b>always</b>
requires you to hit the Refresh command (<b>F5 </b>in keyboard). You can,
if you want, modify your HFVExplorer.ini file located in the Windows home
directory,&nbsp; to make HFVExplorer try to detect Mac floppies when the
floppy icon is clicked:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Setup]</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DisableAutoFloppy=0</tt>
<p>This feature is disabled by default, due to some unresolved (rare) crash
reports. Use at your own risk.
<p>Clicking an volume file displays its contents. You can also use (keyboard)
<b>arrow
keys</b> to move in the tree, just like in Windows Explorer.
<p>You can press "<b>Tabulator</b>" key (keyboard) to switch between volume
tree and
<a href="#list_view">volume contents</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The uppermost entry in the tree, "Configurations", is not yet implemented.
(I don't even remember any more what was the bright idea.)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="list_view"></a>Volume contents</h2>

<p><br>Here's a list of all the keyboard accelerators that may be used:
<blockquote>"<b>Tabulator</b>" key switches between list and
<a href="#tree_view">tree
view</a>.
<p><b>Arrow keys</b> are used to move the selection to a next item.
<p>"<b>Enter</b>" key on a folder moves into the folder. <b>Enter</b> key
on an application or document attempts to launch it into the <a href="#Shortcuts_options">default
emulator</a>.
<p>"<b>F3</b>" function key is reserved for the <b>Find</b> command (not
yet implemented).
<p>"<b>F4</b>" function key opens the file type <a href="#Copying_options">mappings
dialog</a>, and prefills the dialog with values of the selected item(s).
<p>"<b>F5</b>" key is used to refresh. It reloads all the volume files
and checks for floppies and CD's.
<p><b>Alt-Enter</b> opens the <a href="#right_mouse_button">context sensitive
popup menu</a>, the same as the right mouse click.
<p><b>Control-Enter</b> when a folder is selected opens a new instance
of HFVExplorer. This is not yet particularly useful, but will be when one
can drop files between the programs.
<p><a NAME="command_rename"></a>To rename a file or folder, select it and
hit the <b>F2</b> (keyboard) key. Name locked items cannot be renamed without
<a href="#properties_command">removing
the lock first</a>. Renaming a file goes like this:
<center>
<p><img SRC="rename_example.gif" height=358 width=448></center>
<b>Control-A</b> (keyboard) key can be used to <a href="#command_select_all">select
all</a> the files and folders.
<p><b>Control-X,</b> <b>Control-C</b> and <b>Control-V</b> are used to
<a href="#cut_n_paste">cut,
copy and paste</a>.
<p>Typing some letters from the beginning of a file name selects the file,
if found.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
The use of right mouse button is described <a href="#right_mouse_button">elsewhere</a>.
<p>The windows may be in different <a href="#menu_view">view modes.</a>
<p>There is one special button: <font size=+2>(<img SRC="up_button.gif" height=46 width=59>)</font>
, the "up to previous folder" button<font size=+2>.</font> Double-clicking
this button, or hitting <b>Enter</b> moves you one level upwards in the
directory tree. Alternatively, the <b>backspace</b> key (keyboard) may
be used. The special button is not available in the Finder view mode (there
is no "good" place for it), but the backspace key can be used at any time.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="status_bar"></a>Status bar</h2>

<p><br>When the cursor is moved over a tool bar button, status bar displays
short info on the command below the cursor:
<p><img SRC="status_bar_1.gif" height=21 width=593>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Otherwise, current volume, folder and the amount of free space is shown
in status bar:

this:</blockquote>

<center>
<p><br><img SRC="dlg_new_volume.gif" height=275 width=438></center>

<blockquote>First enter a name for your new volume. It must be at most
27 characters long, and may not contain colons (":") or backslashes ("\").
<p>Select the volume size next. Open the combo box to see some preconfigured
sizes. However, you are not required to stick with those, but can enter
any size you like (between 800k and 2GB). Just type "57MB" (without quotes)
to format a 57 megabyte volume file.
<p>To format a floppy, click on the combo-box highlighted with a <font color="#FF0000">red</font>
circle, and select the floppy drive -- either A: or B:. To format a volume
file, click on the button indicated with <font color="#33FF33">green</font>
ellipse.
<p>When you are ready, click OK to start the process. It will take a while,
and there's no proper progress indicator at the moment, but you will no
doubt notice when the new volume is ready: the hard disk (or floppy) stops
making noise and HFVExplorer mounts the new volume.
<p>There is an alternative way to format a volume file: right-click an
empty space in Windows Explorer. Select <i>New/HFVExp Document</i>. Double-click
the new document. HFVExplorer will launch, prompt the name and the size
of the file, and format it.</blockquote>

<center><img SRC="icon_mode_difference.gif" height=280 width=757></center>

<blockquote>The first time Finder view is selected, HFVExplorer displays
the view last used in the Finder, either list, small icons or large icons.
If you select Finder view mode again when <i>already</i> in Finder view,
a large icon Finder view is forced. (Curiously enough, this was originally
a bug in HFVExplorer, but I liked the feature and decided not to fix it.)
<p>Finder view, unlike the all other modes, also writes back the positions
of the icons if you move them around. There is a caveat: if you copy or
move files when in Finder mode, the positions are not immediately recorded,
but only after you move them <b>again</b> using mouse. This is a security
measure since I have yet to come up with a decent automatic icon placement
algorithm, something similar or (hopefully) better than found in MacOS
Finder.
<p>The repositioning uses Finder "magic rectangles", and requires a MacOS
System version 7.1.1 or later to work. Note that Finder relocates items
only when it "sees" them; if some application (including Finder itself;
i.e. "Recent" folders) has installed new files and you have never opened
the window in Finder, the files may be layered on top of each other. HFVExplorer
tries to place them "somewhere".

HFVExplorer supports five emulators. They all have separate setup pages
(read down). The parameters (application path, possibly document path)
are passed to the emulator using various techniques, usually by creating
an alias into the "System Folder:Startup Items" folder. Executor requires
a different method; parameters are passed either in the command line (Executor
Win32 version) or in a parameter file (Executor DOS version).

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="Mounting"></a>Mounting volumes</h1>
"Mounting" is a term commonly used with file systems and devices. It simply
means making the volume file (or whatever) accessible to the target system.
<p>When HFVExplorer is started, it scans the home directory for all files
named as *.HFV (Executor volume files), *.DSK (vMac volume files) and *.HFx
where 'x' is a digit 0..9 (Fusion volume files). If the file contains a
valid HFS volume, it is mounted automatically. At this time, any floppies
and CD's are checked too for Mac media. If you do not access floppies (or
CD's) often, you can <a href="#General_options">turn off</a> either startup
floppy check or startup CD check, or both.
<p>When a new floppy is inserted, press <b>F5</b> (keyboard) key to refresh
the view.
<p>When a new Mac or hybrid CD is inserted, it is detected and mounted
automatically if you have auto-insert notification enabled. Depending on
the system, it may take some time before HFVExplorer gets the arrival or
removal messages; just be patient. If you don't use auto-insert notification
(maybe because of some cd burner software), or any time you wish to refresh
the view, press the <b>F5</b> key.
<p>Use the <b><a href="#command_open">File menu / Open command</a></b>
to mount a new volume file. After the file is mounted once, next time you
launch HFVExplorer you can use the <a href="#command_recent_files">recent
file list</a> from the file menu to mount it.
<p>Volumes can also be mounted by dragging and dropping a HFV (or DSK,
or HFx) file from Windows Explorer.
<p>There is an alternative way to format a volume file: right-click an
empty space in Windows Explorer. Select <i>New/HFVExp Document</i>. Double-click
the new document. HFVExplorer will launch, prompt the name and the size
of the file, and format it.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="Transfer"></a>Transferring files</h1>
You can copy and move files using two methods: dragging and dropping, and
copy/paste commands.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="drag_n_drop"></a>Drag and drop</h2>
For a long time, this was the only way to copy and move files in HFVExplorer.
<center>
<p><img SRC="copy_by_d_n_d.gif" height=369 width=788></center>

<p>In the picture above, the user has started to drag the file "WinRC Notes"
from a Mac volume over the Windows volume "G:\", which is highlighted to
indicate where the file would drop if the mouse button was released now.
Note the cursor shape. It indicates whether the file will be <b>copied</b>
(<img SRC="cursor_cp.gif" height=28 width=25>)or <b>moved (<img SRC="cursor_mv.gif" height=19 width=13>)</b>.
When you drag and drop within the same volume, a <b>move</b> is assumed
by default. When dragging and dropping between different volumes, a <b>copy</b>
operation is assumed. Holding the <b>shift</b> (keyboard) key down you
can force a move, and holding <b>control</b> key down forces a copy. The
cursor is updated accordingly. Control and shift keys were chosen to achieve
maximum compatibility with Windows Explorer.
<p>When the mouse button is released, either a copy or move will take place.
If the source volume type is different than the target volume type (one
being an HFS volume and the other not), <a href="#file_conversions">file
conversions</a> may take place <a href="#Copying_options">if so specified</a>,
or
<a href="#file_type_mappings">file type mappings</a>, again <a href="#Copying_options">if
so specified</a>.
<p><a NAME="ask_copy_mode"></a>If the file conversion is performed, it
is done silently, without asking you anything. Depending on the settings
mentioned above, the file conversion may present you the following dialog:
<center>
<p><img SRC="dyn_copy_mode_select.gif" height=189 width=390></center>

<p>... and you select the copy mode from the combo box, and click <b>OK</b>
for each individual file or subfolder, or <b>OK to All</b> to use the selected
mode for the rest of the files.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="cut_n_paste"></a>Cut, Copy and paste</h2>
This is a rather new feature in HFVExplorer, but has already proven to
be very nice way to copy and move files. It is an enhanced version of Windows
Explorer copying, in that the "...Append" family of commands makes it easy
to move freely from folder to folder, volume to volume, and all the time
accumulate a list of files that will eventually be copied/moved with the
final "Paste" command.
<p>Conventional copy/paste, without Append commands, is performed like
this:
<ol>
<li>
Go to some volume or folder (source).</li>

<li>
Select a set of files.</li>

<li>
Select command "Copy".</li>

<li>
Go to a different volume or folder (target).</li>

<li>
Select command "Paste".</li>
</ol>
Append -style copying is performed like this:
<ol>
<li>
Go to some volume or folder (source).</li>

<li>
Select a set of files.</li>

<li>
Select command "Copy".</li>

<li>
Go to some other volume or folder (next source).</li>

<li>
Select command "Copy Append".</li>

<li>
Repeat the steps 4 and 5 as many times as you like.</li>

<li>
Go to a different volume or folder (target).</li>

<li>
Select command "Paste". All of the files are copied now.</li>
</ol>
Moving files is done exactly the same way, just replace the word "Copy"
in the example above with the word "Cut", and words "Copy Append" with
"Cut Append".
<p>You can go even further if you wish: when collecting the files, you
can freely mix the commands "Copy Append" and "Cut Append". The commands
will be remembered, and the final "Paste" will copy some of the files and
move the rest.
<p>Of course, you should not change any removable media (floppies or CD's)
when doing a copy/paste.
<p><b>Escape</b> key clears the clipboard, and so does the conventional
"Copy" and "Cut" commands -- they initiate a new copy sequence.

<p><br>Those familiar with <a href="#RelatedWork">HFS utils by Robert Leslie</a>&nbsp;
will find this section quite familiar. Please read this anyway, since there
are a few enhancements.
<p>There are 6 algorithms on how to copy the files:
<p><b><i>MacBinary 2</i></b>
<blockquote>Mac files may have both data and resource forks and they are
preserved. Creates "*.bin" Windows files.</blockquote>
<b><i>Binhex</i></b>
<blockquote>Mac files may have both data and resource forks and they are
preserved. Creates "*.hqx" Windows files. There are some binhex formats
that are not supported.</blockquote>
<b><i>Text with cr/lf conversion</i></b>
<blockquote>Line ends are converted according to the platform specific
conversions. Macs use single CR (carriage return), Windows uses CR and
LF (carriage return and line feed). This conversion may change the size
of the file.</blockquote>
<b><i>Raw copy, data fork</i></b>
<blockquote>Only the data fork of the file is copied. Many (but not all)
documents contain only the data fork. You can use the <a href="#file_type_mappings">file
type mappings</a> when this mode is selected.</blockquote>
<b><i>Raw copy, resource fork</i></b>
<blockquote>Only the resource fork of the file is copied. You can use the
<a href="#file_type_mappings">file
type mappings</a> when this mode is selected. This mode is useful, among
other things, when doing cross-platform development. Macintosh 68k binary
files contain data in resource fork only (until the program puts some data
in, if it ever will),</blockquote>
<b><i>Automatic</i></b>
<blockquote>Determines automatically which one of the modes listed above
should be used.
<p>When copying files from HFS to Windows:
<ul>
<li>
If the file has type "TEXT" and creator "ttro", uses text with cr/lf mapping.</li>

<li>
if&nbsp; the resource fork is empty uses raw copy, data fork.</li>

<li>
Otherwise uses MacBinary 2</li>
</ul>
When copying files from Windows to HFS:
<ul>
<li>
Files with extension ".bin" are converted with Mac Binary II</li>

<li>
Files with extension ".hqx" are converted with Binhex</li>

<li>
Files with extensions ".txt", ".c" and ".h" are converted with cr/lf conversion</li>

<li>
Otherwise raw data copy is used.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>AppleDouble</i></b>
<blockquote>There is (incomplete) support for AppleDouble files, used by
<a href="#RelatedWork">Executor</a>.
HFVExplorer can display the icons and copy AppleDouble files to different
locations, but it cannot create AppleDouble files.</blockquote>

<p><br><b><i>SFM</i></b>
<blockquote>There is also incomplete support for Windows NT&nbsp; Services
for Macintosh (SFM) mounted directories. HFVExplorer can display the icons
of the files, but cannot yet properly copy the files. This is a work in
progress.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="file_type_mappings"></a>File type mappings</h2>
&nbsp;
<h3>
Setup dialog</h3>
These settings apply only when the <a href="#file_conversions">copy mode</a>
is "raw data" or "raw resource".
<p>Note that you can have multiple mappings for one dos extension in direction
HFS->DOS, but only one in direction DOS->HFS. Similarly, many dos extensions
may map to the same type/creator pair, but in the direction HFS->DOS only
one type/creator pair is allowed. <a href="#typemap_sample_start">The example</a>
should make this less confusing.
<p>If the currently selected item conflicts with some other item, you will
see text CONFLICT at the top of the dialog. Typically you'll see this after
every DUPLICATE command until you change the new line. Conflicts are removed
when you restart the program or open the dialog again.
<p>Your default mappings are saved in "\Windows\HFVExplorer.ftm". Back
up this file when you have done most of your definitions.
<p>Tip: select some items in HFVExplorer list view, right-click one of
them and give command "Map selected items" (or hit <b>F4</b>).

<h3>
<a NAME="typemap_sample_start"></a>Example</h3>
There is a chance that previous chapter was somewhat confusing to you.
Never fear, this example probably will make things clearer. We start from
scratch; you have no type mappings at all defined, and you have two text
files, one made by SimpleText and the other made by Tex-Edit. For the purposes
of this example, we prefer Tex-Edit over Simple Text.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>

<p><img SRC="typemap_sampe_01.gif" height=232 width=326></center>

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="typemap_sampe_02.gif" height=155 width=650></center>
Here are the two text files in a new folder. Select the files first, and
then hit <b>F4</b> (keyboard) key to open the type mapping dialog.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="typemap_sampe_03.gif" height=405 width=562></center>

<p>HFVExplorer opens the dialog shown above. It has extracted the type
and creator information for the files, but some info is now required from
you. Particularly note the text "C O N F L I C T ..." at the top of the
dialog. It means that the selected mapping is not ok, because two different
mappings try to map the type "???" to something.

ellipse</font> is the DOS extension; we entered "TXT" for both of the types.
The descriptive text in the <font color="#33FF33">green ellipse</font>
is optional, but for convenience, we entered here the descriptions -- "Simple
Text file" and "Tex-Edit file". The <font color="#FF0000">red circle</font>
is the interesting part. We unchecked it for SimpleText, but left Tex-Edit
checked. This means that whenever we copy from DOS to HFS volumes a TXT
file, Tex-Edit type and creator information is used, not SimpleText. We
simply cannot have both. Note that as a result, HFVExplorer does not complain
with "C O N F L I C T ..." any more.
<p>That's it, the mappings are ready. We close the dialog with OK, and
let's try it out by <a href="#Transfer">copying the files</a> to the drive
"E:\".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="typemap_sampe_06.gif" height=189 width=390></center>

<p>The file type mappings work only for "Raw copy" copy modes, and we know
that the text is in the data fork. Therefore, we select "<b>Raw copy, data
fork</b>" and click the <b>Ok to All</b> button.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="typemap_sampe_07.gif" height=133 width=303></center>

<p>The E: drive now has two new files, and the extension is TXT for both
of them.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="typemap_sampe_08.gif" height=189 width=390></center>

<p>Now let's copy the files back from the E: drive to the HFS volume. Again
we use Raw copy, and want the data to be put in the data fork.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="typemap_sampe_09.gif" height=132 width=303></center>
Both files are now Tex-Edit files.

<p><img SRC="context_menu_1.gif" height=66 width=124></center>

<p><a NAME="new_folder"></a><i>New Folder</i> is used to create, huh, a
new folder. It just prompts you the name of the folder and creates it.
<p><a NAME="Show_Hide_labels"></a><i>Show/Hide labels</i> toggles the label

<p><i>Delete</i> prompts for a confirmation to delete the selected file(s)
and if you agree, does it.
<p><i>Map selected files</i>... opens a dialog where you can <a href="#file_type_mappings">define

<p><i>Open with...</i> opens another submenu where you can select into
which emulator launch the selected document or application.
<p><a NAME="create_shortcut"></a><i>Create Shortcut for...</i> opens a
submenu where you select the target emulator. A shortcut will be placed
on your Windows desktop. The Mac icon is extracted and saved to a subdirectory
"Links" which is created in the HFVExplorer home directory. You can later
on launch the application/document by double-clicking the desktop icon,
HFVExplorer does not need to be running at that time. The helper application
"vMacLink" is used to pass the information to the emulator, except in case
of Executor (parameters are passed in command line or parameter file).
<p><i>New Folder</i> is described <a href="#new_folder">above</a>.
<p><a NAME="save_icon"></a><i>Save icon...</i> prompts for a file name
and saves the Mac icon of the selected item. You can also take the icons

<p><a NAME="trouble_cd_1"></a><b>PROBLEM</b>: None of the Mac CD's mount.
<blockquote><a href="#Installation">Make sure</a> that you copied Cdenable.vxd
(Windows 9x) or Cdenable.sys (Windows NT 4-5) to the correct folder.
<p>Check the size of Cdenable.vxd (does not apply to Windows NT). For some
time, I kept an unzipped version available at my site, and some people
downloaded it with recent versions of&nbsp; Netscape, which seem to have
major trouble in determining which files are text files and which ones
are not. Unfortunately, Netscape thinks Cdenable.vxd is a text file, and
performs a cr/lf&nbsp; line end conversion, resulting in a corrupted file.
The correct size (currently) is 10400 bytes, the corrupted size was 10445
bytes.

<a NAME="trouble_cd_2"></a><b>PROBLEM</b>: Some Mac CD's mount, some don't.
<blockquote>It has turned out that Toast (a cd burner software for Macintosh,
by Adaptec) allows writing of CD's with very long volume names. Although
it correctly cuts the name at 27 characters in MDB, the entry in Catalog
File is longer which causes problems for&nbsp; HFVExplorer. To mount such
CD's, edit the file "HFVExplorer.ini" in your Windows directory as shown
below:
<p><tt>&nbsp; [Setup]</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; UsePartialNames=1 ; default value is 0</tt>
<p>If there is an entry "UsePartialNames" already, change the value to
be "1", otherwise create new entry. This has the effect that any requests
to the hfsutils core are made with partial file paths instead of full file
paths:
<p><tt>":MyFolder:Myfile.xxx"</tt>
<p>instead of
<p><tt>"MyMacVolume:MyFolder:Myfile.xxx"</tt>
<p>Once I'm sure that this works always, I may turn it on by default.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="trouble_floppy_1"></a><b>PROBLEM</b>: Mac floppy disks
do not mount.
<blockquote>Only 1.4MB Mac floppies can be read in HFVExplorer. 400k and
800k Mac floppies cannot me read, due to the limitations of PC floppy controller.
<p>The floppies are not mounted automatically, you need to press the <b>F5</b>
(keyboard) key to detect them.</blockquote>
<a NAME="trouble_icon_1"></a><b>PROBLEM</b>: Shortcut icons look worse
on Windows desktop than in HFVExplorer.
<blockquote>Starting from version 1.2.7, HFVExplorer saves icons in 256
colors. To show the icons correctly in Windows desktop, enable in Control
panel: "Display" / "Plus!" / "Show icons using all possible colors".</blockquote>
<a NAME="trouble_start_slow_1"></a><b>PROBLEM</b>: Launching of HFVExplorer
seems to get slower and slower.
<blockquote>HFVExplorer uses very extensive icon caching. It stores virtually
all Mac icons it ever sees (except custom icons) in a file "HFVICONS.DAT".
This results in fast browsing, but there are no free lunches: the startup
time grows longer. If you feel that it has gone intolerably far, just delete
the file. HFVExplorer will notice this, and start collecting the icons
again. First it may seem that some files which previously had icons don't
have them any more (like documents and preferences), but eventually they
will reappear as you browse through the folders containing the applications
that created the files.
<p>Moreover, if you have been using HFVExplorer for a long time and never
deleted the cache file, it is a good idea to do it now. Some time ago there
was fixes for some icon related bugs. These bugs caused bad looking icons,
but you won't notice any difference until the cache is deleted once.
<p>Disabling <a href="#startup_floppy_check">floppy check</a> and <a href="#startup_cd_check">CD
check</a> is another way to make the startup faster.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<a NAME="trouble_flicker_1"></a><b>PROBLEM</b>: There's a lot of screen
updating after copying and moving files.
<blockquote>The reasons for this are historical. HFVExplorer originally
used it's own read-only HFS functions, but version 1.1.0 incorporated <a href="#RelatedWork">HFS
utils</a> code which allows me to write to the volumes. However, some parts
of the program still use the original functions, and to keep the things
in synch a refresh is sometimes needed.
<p>There's nothing you can do for it. Fixing this would require a major
rewrite. I have not decided whether I will do that.

<ul>
<li>
Copying when the file already exists: behaves badly, does not ask for confirmation
to overwrite. If you copy a file and there is a *folder* with same name,
not even error message is given, and the copying fails.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
CD eject button does not work with some configurations (HP7110e &amp; NT
is a known problem) and freezes. Reason unknown, could be driver or firmware.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
In report view, file dates seem to be wrong (again/still?). I thought that
it was fixed. oh well.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Properties and file mappings with F4 does not work for AppleDouble files.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Root folder of DOS volumes: two first items are overlapped (in some systems).
Could be a bug in Common dialog control libraries, since not all systems
have this problem.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
AppleDouble launching for Executor DOS works only with short file names.
Not much I can do for it.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
vMac launch has problems under NT 5 beta 2. Seems to be a beta bug, cannot
resolve shortcuts properly.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Finder view mode: in some systems, the scroll bars always appear and the
window is scrolled a few pixels. Very annoying. Strangely enough, I cannot
repeat this on my development machine. I can repeat it with my backup machine
so there's hope to get it eventually fixed. Could be a bug in MFC libraries
which is already fixed.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Options dialog: some "browse" buttons outsmart themselves when a directory
name contains spaces.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Shapeshifter launching crashes sometimes if "Remove alias" is on. Hard
to fix since it can be repeated by manually launching two aliases in SS
within narrow enough time frame. If this happens to you, do not use "Remove
alias".</li>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;
<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="WishList"></a>Wish list</h1>

<ul>
<li>
Support for Services for Macintosh (SFM) under Windows NT. There is now
minimal support (showing icons), copying is not yet implemented.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Unimplemented: "Find" command.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Unimplemented: Preview window (I forgot the whole thing...)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If you open a second browser window (Control-double click on folder, or
control-enter) it can't access HFS floppies (under NT at least). "Second
browser" is quite useless feature anyway, until one can drop between views.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
OLE drag and drop.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Hard disk access (easy, but there are other issues).</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Expanding Finder view mode to a full-blown Finder replacement (?) This
would require removing the MFC CListView code, it's too restricted.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Icon cache code should be rewritten.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Should upgrade to Robert Leslie's latest hfsutils source tree (w/ blessed
folder). Would allow making bootable volume file.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Should follow folder aliases ('fdrp'), or launch them.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
HFS volume browse dialog (no big deal)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
After delete, tree view still shows the deleted folders...</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Some copy progress dialog.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
F4 should have menu equivalent; and the right-click commands should be
in menu too.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
What should be done when copying FAT files starting with a dot. Traditionally
Mac driver names only, Apple says that no normal file name should start
with a dot.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Compressed Mac resources. Undocumented.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
PC link floppies.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Perhaps copying files should always update the icon locations; trying to
keep the original order, but avoiding any overlaps. It is confusing that
(in Finder view mode) you need to move the icons again in order to permanently
record the positions, so that real Finder honors them.</li>

Newer version of BinHex (and MacBinary?).</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.1.1:</tt>
<br><tt>--------------</tt>
<br><tt>- No fatal bugs reported since 1.1.0, so I assume that disk</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; writing functions are ok.</tt>
<p><tt>- Deleting from fat volume was broken (simply didn't delete!)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; in 1.1.0, fixed.</tt>

<p><tt>- Creating own "Desktop" (after format) was a bad idea.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Does not work, but prevents Finder from copying stuff</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp; Erroneous Desktops should be deleted. Affects</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; vMac only, Executor seems not use Desktop.</tt>
<p><tt>- CD support. HFS cd's and hybrid ISO/HFS.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - No support for High Sierra.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - No support for ISO with Apple Extensions.
They are</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shown as FAT volumes, with icon
information missing.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - CD auto notification supported, just pop in
the CD</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it should appear in the tree
view.</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp; - Small memory leak (custom icons).</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 95:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Seems to work ok now. Requires
that CDENABLE.VXD is copied to</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your Windows directory.
System dir is ok too, as any directory</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within path. Do NOT
copy to HFVExplorer directory.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ALSO when HFVExplorer is running,
DOS Executor (and any other</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; program) is able to
see cd's, too - and using protected mode</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drivers! No MSCDEX required.
In some machines, you had to boot</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to MS-DOS mode to see CD drive.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NT 4.0:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More limited so far, does not open
all cd's.</tt>
<p><tt>- AppleDouble now supported when copying/deleting files</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; to HFS volumes. From HFS volumes creates MacBinary II.</tt>
<p><tt>- About box: credits edited. Version updated 1.1.1</tt>
<p><tt>- DSK filter added to "Open" dialog.</tt>
<p><tt>- Some missing tool tips added.</tt>
<p><tt>- NEW icon in tool bar opens now the Format dialog.</tt>
<p><tt>- New way to create volumes: in Windows Explorer,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; right-click and select New/HFVExp Document.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Creates empty file, double-click it to open</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; it in HFV Explorer -> will ask volume name and size.</tt>
<p><tt>- Option dialog: first page is now functional.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.1.1b &amp; c</tt>
<br><tt>------------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Attempted to fix cache bug.</tt>
<br><tt>- Bundle bit was lost when copying HFS -> HFS</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; causing missing icons.</tt>
<p><tt>Version 1.1.1d</tt>
<br><tt>--------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Fixed a bug in reading from CD.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (caused missing icons and the previous "Known bug: sometimes</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; has problems opening items in the root directory of the
CD."</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.1.1e</tt>
<br><tt>--------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Fixed a bug in reading from CD.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Failed to mount some CD's with partition</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; located at very high addresses, near end of disk.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.1.1f</tt>
<br><tt>--------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Following performance improvements:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; - Read-ahead code for CD's.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; - Larger cache.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; - Does not update screen so often any more.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could be still better.</tt>
<br><tt>- Memory leaks fixed.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.1.1g</tt>
<br><tt>--------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Properties dialog. Click file/folder</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; with right mouse button (or Alt-Enter).</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Select properties. Be careful in what you change.</tt>
<br><tt>- Name locked items cannot be renamed any more, without</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; removing the lock first (properties).</tt>
<br><tt>- Tool bar buttons to eject/reload all CD trays.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.1.1h</tt>
<br><tt>--------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Failed to mount hybrid CD's with boot block zeroed out.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Fixed. For example, Executor 2 CD.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.1.1i</tt>
<br><tt>--------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Support for pure Mac CD's under Windows NT.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; CDENABLE.SYS must be copied to your System32\Drivers</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; directory. After copying the driver, the program</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; must be run once with system administrator rights.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Later normal user rights suffice.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.0</tt>
<br><tt>-------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Faster directory browsing. Especially large volumes</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; and directories work better, and CD's. The performance</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; hit was tremendous if the volume had files more than</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; a specific threshold.</tt>
<p><tt>- Multiple item selection -- move, copy, delete.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Works as in Explorer (or in any multi-selection list control).</tt>
<p><tt>- File copy mode selection for HFS -> FAT and FAT -> HFS.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Selected from Options dialog (new property page).</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Maybe in future there will be file type mapping.</tt>
<p><tt>- "Create shortcut" command implemented for Executor/DOS,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Executor/Win32 and vMac, including a launcher app for vMac,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; and an automatic alias creator.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Places an icon on the Windows desktop, pointing to either
a document</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; or an application. Automatic Mac icon extraction.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; If you want the special characters to be shown in icon names,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; change the desktop icon font (Control Panel/Display/</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Appearance/Icon "Font") to something else than MS Sans Serif,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; perhaps Arial, which may be ugly but has more visible characters.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Icons and parameter files are placed into subdirectory "Links".</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Helper directory "vMacLink" contains a link to the vMac
installation.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Click the button "Install files required by vMac" to set
up this</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; directory.</tt>
<p><tt>- "Open with" supports the tree emulators (E/DOS, E/Win32, vMac).</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; *** IMPORTANT *** : DO NOT try to copy/move/delete/create
new files</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; in HFVExplorer when the emulator is running. MacOS doesn't
like</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; anything happening behind its back. The file accesses are
not properly</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; synchronized, and if unlucky, you may suffer data loss.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; HFVExplorer tries to protect you from this, but its protection</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; schemes are far from perfect. It takes care that its own
data</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; structures are always in sync, but the emulators don't do
this.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; After the emulator terminates, HFVExplorer checks if it
needs to</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; update the file structures and if so, it does this. That's
the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; reason why it takes a while when emulator terminates --
if one bit</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; of data has changed in a volume file, the only safe way
is to</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; reload the whole volume.</tt>
<p><tt>- You should normally use the alias launching method with vMac,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; and only try Apple events method if this fails. Executor
users</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; should not be concerned with the launching method since
appropriate</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; way is selected automatically. Just make sure that you don't</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; claim in the setup dialog that your Windows Executor is
DOS</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; or vice versa -- this information has to be correct.</tt>
<p><tt>- Icon corruption bug fixed. To get rid of the old</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; corrupted icons, the icon cache file "HFVICONS.DAT" must
be deleted.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; HFVExplorer will ask you whether it's ok to delete this
file.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; After deleting the file, you may notice that some icons,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; typically various preference files but some documents as
well,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; do not have proper icons. This is normal, since HFVExplorer</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; does not load icons from MacOS Desktop file or Desktop database,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; but uses its own system. The icons will eventually reappear
after</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; you browse through the folder containing the creator applications</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; which has the bundle resources and icons.</tt>
<p><tt>- Resolves folder custom icons.</tt>
<p><tt>- Resolves (some) alias types icons.</tt>
<p><tt>- HFS and FAT default icons are now in different colors.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; The new plain icons are best shown if you have window color
something</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; different than white (Control Panel/Display/Appearance/item
"Window")</tt>
<p><tt>- Folder "Icon\x00D" file is copied out to FAT volumes as "Icon~"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; This file contains the custom icons of a folder, if any.</tt>
<p><tt>- CD's were mounted as R/W file systems, causing strange error</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; messages even when copying succeeded.</tt>
<p><tt>- Accelerator F2 to edit file name.</tt>
<p><tt>- Obsolete tool buttons removed, new buttons added</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; to read a volume file from floppy and write one to a floppy.</tt>
<p><tt>- Some more tool tips added.</tt>
<p><tt>- Possibility to limit the time spent in creating DOS icons.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; In options dialog.</tt>
<p><tt>- Mac vs. ANSI character set fixes. Some characters may still</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; be incorrect, but see the note in "Create shortcut" above.</tt>
<p><tt>- Uses Arial font in most places now. Yes I know it's ugly,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; but MS Sans Serif does not have some important special</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; characters.</tt>
<p><tt>- Possibility to hide/show "invisible" files.</tt>
<p><tt>- Pressing return or double-clicking now opens Executor/Win32 by
default.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; You can change this behavior from the options dialog.</tt>
<p><tt>- Changing of "is alias" enabled in properties dialog.</tt>
<p><tt>- Many miscellaneous bug fixes.</tt>
<p><tt>- Hook1508 -- a tool to help DOS Executor see the HFS (non-hybrid)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; CD's under Windows NT 4.0. Not included in this&nbsp; archive,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; available at http://www.clinet.fi/~lpesonen/ftp/executor</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; If you intend to use Hook1508 with HFVExplorer shortcuts
and/or</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; launching, you should either create a .bat or modify AUTOXEC.NT,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; or make a custom version AUTOXEC.NT. The procedure is described</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; in Hook1508 read me file.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.0 -- additon to same version</tt>
<br><tt>-------------</tt>
<br><tt>- "Icon\x00D" is now treated as invisible file even if the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; corresponding flag is not set.</tt>
<p><tt>- Explained the netbios problem under NT.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.1</tt>
<br><tt>-------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Configurable font and point size (Options/General)</tt>
<br><tt>- Remembers window position and size</tt>
<br><tt>- Mac floppies are now detected when "A:\" is clicked.</tt>
<br><tt>- Bugs in emulator launching code fixed</tt>
<br><tt>- Minor cosmetic fixes</tt>
<br><tt>- List view now always shows the selection</tt>
<br><tt>- Some special characters fixed in AppleDouble names</tt>
<br><tt>- CD support for Windows 98, was previously a separate download.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (Check the size of \Windows\System\cdenable.vxd -- should
be 10400 bytes.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Some users experienced file corruption when downloading
the separate vxd.)</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.2</tt>
<br><tt>-------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Japanese font support, thanks to Mr. Noda (noda@lyra.vega.or.jp).</tt>
<br><tt>- Japanese users please check the option "Font character set is
SJIS (Japanese)"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; in "General" page of the options, change Font (for example
"MS gothic")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; and restart HFVExplorer.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.3</tt>
<br><tt>-------------</tt>
<br><tt>- File type conversion table DOS extension &lt;--> MacOS type/creator.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; See "Options/Copying Files/Raw copy file type mappings".</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Click the "?" button for help.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Initially, the program comes with no preset mappings, but
once you</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; have typed in some they can be easily shared with other
people with</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; export/import commands.</tt>
<br><tt>- New right-click popup menu command to prefill the mapping dialog</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; with currently selected item(s), either DOS or HFS files
will do.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Function key F4 does the same thing.</tt>
<br><tt>- Copying files between HFS and DOS does not change ' ' &lt;->
'_' any more.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Some other character mapping fixes in file names.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.4</tt>
<br><tt>-------------</tt>
<br><tt>- File type conversion table (1.2.3): fixed a bug which caused
types and</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; creators that contain special characters to be ignored.</tt>
<p><tt>- In report (details) list view, columns may now be sorted by clicking</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; the column header. Click again to reverse the order (asdending/descending).</tt>
<p><tt>- Creating new volume file is much faster now.</tt>
<p><tt>- Yet another experimental feature: "Finder view mode" tool button.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Shows the files and folders in original positions and uses
Finder "magic rectangle"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; to reposition moved icons. Use a small font point size.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; Works under any System version, but positioning new items
works only under</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; System 7.1.1 or later.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; Note that Finder relocates items only when it "sees" them;
if some application</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; (including Finder itself; i.e. "Recent" folders) has installed
new files</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; and you have never opened the window in Finder, the files
may be layered</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; on top of each other. HFVExplorer tries to place them "somewhere".</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; If you copy new files into a folder and do not move them
in "Finder view mode",</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; they may not be shown exactly in same positions in Finder
and HFVExplorer.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; This is because HFVExplorer does not try to mimic the Finder
automatic</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; placement function. Either move them in HFVExplorer or visit
the folder in Finder.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; "Go up..." button is not available in Finder view, there
is no good place for it.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Use the new keyboard shortcut Backspace to move upwards
(used to work when the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; focus was in tree view, now works always).</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; (Check "http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tb/tb_42.html"
for a discussion</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; on the problems when positioning Finder icons.)</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.5 (in-house)</tt>
<br><tt>------------------------</tt>
<br><tt>- DOS report view said that all folders have "0 items". Fixed.</tt>
<br><tt>- AppleDouble report view displayed an incorrect number for folder
item count. Fixed.</tt>
<br><tt>- A message "Failed to set item properties" was generated every
time</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; when trying to move within a window in read-only media,
when "Finder view"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; was selected. Fixed.</tt>
<br><tt>- Launch support for WinUAE/Shapeshifter (please see the bug list).</tt>
<br><tt>- Launch support for Fusion demo (not completed).</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.6</tt>
<br><tt>-------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Sorting by HFS creation/modification date was intolerably slow.
Fixed.</tt>
<br><tt>- Some icons crashed the program. Now they shouldn't any more,
but they</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; are shown garbled. Not perfect, but will do for now.</tt>
<br><tt>- Some popup menu reorderings.</tt>
<br><tt>- Fixed some problems with WinUAE/Shapeshifter launching.</tt>
<br><tt>- Launch support for Fusion finished.</tt>
<br><tt>- Alias launching for vMac, Fusion and ShapeShifter: optionally,
installs</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; a tiny Mac app into Startup folder (HFVExplorer Remover).
It's only purpose</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; is to wait in background for 5 seconds and then delete the
alias.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; This is safer than the old method which deleted the alias
under Windows.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Check "Remove alias" in the corresponding emulator dialog
to activate this feature.</tt>
<br><tt>- Apple events launching should not be used any more.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.6 (addition)</tt>
<br><tt>------------------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Updated bug list.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.7 (icon facelift release)</tt>
<br><tt>-------------------------------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Compressed icons are not shown any more (result was garbage).</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Generic icons are used instead. Decompression algorithm
is not documented, see:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tb/tb_555.html</tt>
<br><tt>- Icons 16 colors -> 256 colors. Both in list view and shortcuts.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Requires "thousands of colors" display mode at minimum.
15, 16, 24 and 32 bits supported.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; To show the icons correctly in Windows desktop, enable in
Control panel:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; "Display" / "Plus!" / "Show icons using all possible colors".</tt>
<br><tt>- "Save icon..." command (right click menu), works for folders
too.</tt>
<br><tt>- Finder label colors. Displayed as superimposed colored pedestals
right below</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; the icons. Not perfect (will probably change later), but
the way MacOS shows</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; the labels of colored icons is (arguably) even worse.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Right click items to change labels.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Uses default colors and texts (Red=Hot, Orange=Essential
etc).</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.8</tt>
<br><tt>-------------</tt>
<br><tt>- It turned out that Toast allows writing of CD's with very long
volume</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; names. Although it correctly cuts the name at 27 characters
in MDB,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; the entry in Catalog File is longer which causes problems
for</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; HFVExplorer. To mount such CD's, edit the file "HFVExplorer.ini"
in</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; your Windows directory as shown below:</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; [Setup]</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; UsePartialNames=1 ; default value is 0</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; If there is entry "UsePartialNames" already, change the value
to be "1",</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; otherwise create new entry.</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; This has the effect that any requests to the hfsutils core
are made</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; with partial file paths instead of full file paths:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ":MyFolder:Myfile.xxx"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; instead of</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "MyMacVolume:MyFolder:Myfile.xxx"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Once I'm sure that this works always, I may turn it on by
default.</tt>
<p><tt>- Support for volume files named as HFx (where x is anything).</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.9 (bug fixes)</tt>
<br><tt>-------------------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Fixed some special character issues when copying files</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; between HFS and FAT file systems.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.10 (bug fixes)</tt>
<br><tt>--------------------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Folder custom icons were lost when copying from HFS -> FAT and
back again.</tt>
<br><tt>- A bug in deletion fixed (HFS &amp; FAT); sometimes, one had to
try delete twice</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; before a nested folder was completely deleted.</tt>
<br><tt>- If a folder name had any special characters, then the creation
of a subfolder</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; below it failed (when copying a deep&nbsp; directory structure).</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; This was a new bug in 1.2.9.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.11 (clipboard release)</tt>
<br><tt>----------------------------------</tt>
<br><tt>- "Cut", "Copy" &amp; "Paste" -- these work mostly like in Explorer.</tt>
<br><tt>- "Cut Append" &amp; "Copy Append" -- the selected items are appended
to the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; clipboard file list. You can even mix "Cut Append" and "Copy
Append"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; commands so that one "Paste" command copies some files and
cuts some.</tt>
<br><tt>- Escape empties the clipboard ("Cut" and "Copy" also empty it
before a refill)</tt>
<br><tt>- Added more checks for illegal copy attempts. The destination
folder may</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; not be a subfolder of the source folder, etc.</tt>
<br><tt>- "Select All" command. Control-A.</tt>
<br><tt>- When moving directory structures between HFS and FAT, not all
files</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; were deleted but empty directories was left behind. Fixed.</tt>
<br><tt>- The default action changed when the "A:\" or "B:\" floppy symbols
are clicked.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Starting from version 1.2.1, Mac floppies were detected
too, but this</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; is not the case any more. There seems to be some very nasty
bug related</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; to this feature, and therefore it's only accessible by manually
editing</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; HFVExplorer.ini. If you really want that feature back, change
the following:</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Setup]</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DisableAutoFloppy=0</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; Normally, you should press F5 to refresh the screen after</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; inserting/changing/removing floppies.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>Version 1.2.12</tt>
<br><tt>--------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Tool buttons for "Cut Append" &amp; "Copy Append".</tt>
<br><tt>- One comment was left out about 1.2.11 "Append" command</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; description: note that you can append from different</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; folders, even from different volumes and medias (but do</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; not change the floppy or cd when collecting files).</tt>
<br><tt>- HTML help.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="History_latest"></a><tt>Version 1.2.13</tt>
<br><tt>--------------</tt>
<br><tt>- Launching Mac documents with Windows applications (a new "emulator").</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; The documents are copied to the Windows temporary folder
and opened.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; When the application (not document) is closed, the user
is prompted</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; whether to update the changes, if there are any.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Multiple documents can be open at the same time. The changes
are tracked</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; file by file.</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; If the original document does not have an extension, a file
type</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; mapping must be created; a dialog box will open automatically.</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; Under Windows NT, launching to 16 bit Windows apps does not</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; work properly. The document opens ok, but HFVExplorer does
not</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; recognize when the application is terminated.</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>- Default emulator (after first time installation) is now the one</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; described above.</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>- Copying HFS->FAT: file type mappings are not enforced</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; any more if the path already contains an(y) extension.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;

If you don't want to use HFVExplorer for any reason, you may want to check
out the other more or less similar utilities listed here. In fact even
if you <b>do</b> like HFVExplorer, I suggest that you give the other programs
a try. They are all decent tools, and nothing prevents you from using all
of them if you wish. I'm not aware of any conflict between them and HFVExplorer,
even some synergy can be observed.

files an use the files within transparently. I tested the combination MacOpener/seNTry
once and it worked fine. I'm sure there are similar solutions for Windows
9x too, but since I rarely boot into Win9x any more, I wouldn't really
know.
<p><a href="http://www.asy.com">TransMac by Acute Systems</a>: a nice HFS
volume browser.
<p><a href="http://www.macwindows.com">MacWindows site</a> has an extensive
list of similar utilities.
