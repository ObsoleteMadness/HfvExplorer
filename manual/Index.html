latest version 1.2.13</a>.
<p>New in this release:
<ul>
<li>
Launching Mac documents with Windows applications (a new "emulator"). The
documents are copied to the Windows temporary folder and opened. When the
application (not the document) is closed, the user is prompted whether
to update the changes, if there are any. Multiple documents can be open
at the same time; the changes are tracked file by file.<br>
<br>
If the original document does not have an extension, a file type mapping
must be created; a dialog box will open automatically.</li>

<p><br>Under Windows NT, launching to 16 bit Windows apps does not work
properly. The document opens ok, but HFVExplorer does not recognize when
the application is terminated.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Default emulator (after first time installation) is now the one described
above.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Copying HFS->FAT: file type mappings are not enforced any more if the path
already contains an(y) extension.</li>
</ul>
